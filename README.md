# Governance and Development Maps: HDI, CPI, and Political Systems

This repository contains interactive **R Leaflet maps** that visualize global patterns of:

- **Human Development Index (HDI)**  
- **Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)**  
- **Governance systems** (Presidential vs. Parliamentary)

The maps allow users to:
- Toggle between indicators (HDI, CPI, Governance)  
- Compare two variables side by side with **synced maps**  
- Use a **swipe slider** to visually contrast two layers  

All maps are built entirely in **R** using `leaflet`, `leafsync`, and `htmlwidgets`.  
They are published as self-contained HTML files and can be viewed directly in the browser.
